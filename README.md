# Self adaptive neural networks for edge devices.
Master Information Studies (Data Science) - University of Amsterdam

## Abstract:
Deep learning models for vision tasks are increasingly being deployed across multiple venues, including cloud and edge devices, driven by various factors such as privacy concerns, platform reliability, and latency requirements. However, the deployment of state-of-the-art deep models at the edge is often hindered by constraints such as limited memory and inference speed. Moreover, each application operating in different environments possesses unique combinations of requirements.The proposed research question asks how a self-adaptive neural network could be designed to cater for the different requirements of each execution venue in the cloud-to-edge continuum. Different trade-offs can be present for accuracy against other requirements such as inference speed or power efficiency.
